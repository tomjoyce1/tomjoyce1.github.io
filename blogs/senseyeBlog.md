Getting your eyes tested usually means taking time off work, traveling to an optician, and navigating long waiting lists. Not to mention the challenges faced by those in regions with limited access to healthcare. This is what inspired the idea for SensEye: a platform that enables remote eye testing from the comfort of your home. I was responsible for building the technical product.


So what exactly did this entail? The aim was to create an online eye testing platform that leverages artificial intelligence and multimodal imaging to deliver eye health assessments and standardised vision testing - all without needing to leave your house.
In this blog post, I’ll provide a technical overview of how SensEye was built.


**Frontend**
The web [application](https://senseyedetect.vercel.app/) is currently still in development and has not yet been officially launched.
The SensEye frontend is built using Next.js, React, and TypeScript. React was chosen for its ease of use, performance, and scalability. 
Components: I created a library of reusable UI components in React, such as buttons, forms, and cards, to ensure consistency across the app.


Pages: Next.js powers our server-side rendered pages, improving both page load times and SEO.



**Backend**
The backend is developed using Node.js, Express.js, and Drizzle ORM. The backend manages API requests, data processing, and user data storage.
I used Clerk for user authentication and management, as it was a remarkably easy-to-integrate solution. The 3d animation was created with Splinetool.
The application is hosted on Vercel and set up for automatic deployments upon pushing to main.
