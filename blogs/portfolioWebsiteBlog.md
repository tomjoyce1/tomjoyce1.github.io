The Windows 95 OS has already been implemented many, many times. In fact, stumbling across one such portfolio site gave me the inspiration for this website. Rather than merely cloning an existing implementation, I opted to recreate the OS from scratch (heavily using the [98.css](https://jdan.github.io/98.css/) package for UI), and integrate a novel 'Launch' transition to the modern OS. 

Initially I had intended to have a glitch or Matrix style transition between the two versions of Windows within a single html page, but this turned out to be somewhat drawn-out (not to mention jarring), and I opted for a simple transition.

**Windows 11**

The base of the Windows 11 was cloned from [Laaouatni](https://github.com/Laaouatni/w11CSS). This was immensely beneficial and gave a good structure for this half of the project. Building on this, I refactored the code, amended the UI to be more accurate and implemented the transition effect from Windows 95.
