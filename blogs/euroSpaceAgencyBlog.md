## Life Support Systems – Solutions from Space for Earth Programme

I had the incredible opportunity to take part in the pilot edition of the ESA Academy’s [Life Support Systems](https://www.esa.int/Education/ESA_Academy/Be_Part_of_the_Life_Support_Systems_Solutions_from_Space_for_Earth_Training_Course)  training course. The course focused on the intersection of space technology, sustainability, and entrepreneurship. One half of the course was onsite at the ESA Facility in ESEC-Galaxia, Belgium.


The programme revolved around the MELiSSA programme - ESA's closed-loop life support system designed to recycle waste into oxygen, water, and food for future space missions. We delved into the science and engineering behind each MELiSSA compartment, from thermophilic anaerobic bacteria to microbial electrolysis cells.

It was fascinating to explore the intricate interdependencies between biological and physical systems that sustain life aboard the ISS. We also had the chance to visit ESEC-Redu, an ESA ground station, and the large L-band antenna for the Galileo satellite navigation system were very impressive.


I found it interesting to learn about practical terrestrial technologies; like [Hydrohm](https://hydrohm.com/news/), which focuses on reusing domestic wastewater, and was a successful case study of space spin-offs.


My team worked on researching and developing a microbial fuel cell concept which would be a sustainable energy solution inspired by Compartment 2 of MELiSSA. The idea was to harness microbial activity to generate electricity from organic waste, with potential applications in places like breweries with immense organic waste, or off-grid energy, especially in resource-limited environments.

Participating in the programme was an honour, and I am looking forward to hopefully working on the [UL High Powered Rocketry](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ulas-hipr/posts/?feedView=all) team this coming year.
